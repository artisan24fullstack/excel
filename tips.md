# Tips excel

## Take charge of those endless rows and columns

- One of the amazing features of Excel is the sheer endless number of rows and columns. 
- However, sometimes they add to the confusion more than they help. 
- You can actually hide the ones you don't need. 
- Open one of this week's workbooks and try this out step-by-step. 
  
```
Here is how

* Select the first column you don't need to see
* and then press the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+right arrow 
* Right-click anywhere in this new selection and select Hide.

* Select the first row you don't need to see 
* and then press the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+down arrow 
* Right-click anywhere in this new selection and select Hide.
```  

## Order of basic mathematical operations

- Calculations follow the general mathematical rules for calculations, 
- in other words, Multiplication (*) and Division (/) 
- come before Addition (+) and Subtraction (-). 
- So, when you are using these arithmetic operators in your calculations, 
- you need to keep these general rules in mind.

```
Example: =3+4*5 

* Excel reads the formula from left to right, 
* so one might assume that it adds 3 and 4 together 
* before it multiplies the result by 5. 

* However, as multiplication takes precedence over addition, 
* Excel will calculate 3 plus the result of 4 multiplied by 5. 

* If you wanted Excel to choose the first path, 
* you need to 'tell' this to Excel with the help of parentheses.

* The formula should look like this: =(3+4)*5
```


## Conditional Formatting vs. Filtering

```
* They both let you show data based on specific criteria or conditions. 
* Why would you choose one over the other?

* Filtering will only show data that matches the criteria. 
* You can provide multiple filters, 
* but only data that matches all conditions will be visible.

* Conditional formatting will show data that fits any of the conditions chosen. 
* It also provides more visual and graphical elements.
```

## Don't underestimate the right-click 

```
* Right-clicking on a chart in Excel 
* allows you to alter pretty much any part 
* and aspect of a chart.

* The right-click gives you quick 
* and convenient access to most options 
* for a productive and efficient workflow.
```

## Transposing columns into rows (and vice versa)

```
* Every now and then you create a nice set of data
* only to realise that you would have preferred that the data 
* that is currently in columns to appear in rows (or the other way around).

* Excel provides a little-known feature that allows 
* you to do change your rows and columns by transposing them.

* Sometimes you’ll be working with data formatted in columns 
* and you really need it to be in rows (or the other way around). 

* Simply copy the row or column you’d like to transpose, 
* right click on the destination cell and select Paste Special. 

* A checkbox on the bottom of the resulting popup window is labeled Transpose. 
* Check the box and click OK.
* Excel will do the rest.
