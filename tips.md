# Tips excel

## Take charge of those endless rows and columns

- One of the amazing features of Excel is the sheer endless number of rows and columns. 
- However, sometimes they add to the confusion more than they help. 
- You can actually hide the ones you don't need. 
- Open one of this week's workbooks and try this out step-by-step. 
  
```
Here is how

* Select the first column you don't need to see
* and then press the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+right arrow 
* Right-click anywhere in this new selection and select Hide.

* Select the first row you don't need to see 
* and then press the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+down arrow 
* Right-click anywhere in this new selection and select Hide.
```  

## Order of basic mathematical operations

- Calculations follow the general mathematical rules for calculations, 
- in other words, Multiplication (*) and Division (/) 
- come before Addition (+) and Subtraction (-). 
- So, when you are using these arithmetic operators in your calculations, 
- you need to keep these general rules in mind.

```
Example: =3+4*5 

* Excel reads the formula from left to right, 
* so one might assume that it adds 3 and 4 together 
* before it multiplies the result by 5. 

* However, as multiplication takes precedence over addition, 
* Excel will calculate 3 plus the result of 4 multiplied by 5. 

* If you wanted Excel to choose the first path, 
* you need to 'tell' this to Excel with the help of parentheses.

* The formula should look like this: =(3+4)*5
