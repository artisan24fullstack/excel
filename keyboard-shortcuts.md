## Undo/Redo CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y 

```
* Possibly some of the most frequently used keyboard shortcuts ever are CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y 
* Z stands for undo and Y for redo. 
* CTRL-Y will redo your most recent action which comes in really handy if/when you want to apply a certain step more than once. 
* CTRL + Z â€” Undo previous action
```

## New File/ New Workbook CTRL+N 

```
* To create a new workbook or new file, 
* you do not need to go into any menu's. 
* You can simply press: CTRL+N 
```

## Open file / Open Workbook CTRL+O 

```
* To open the dialogue box and select an existing file (workbook) 
* you can use the shortcut: CTRL+O 
```

## Close file / Close Workbook CTRL+W 

```
* To close your current Workbook, 
* you can click on the 'x' located at the top right (Windows), 
* But as shortcut keys are sometimes quicker, 
* you can press: CTRL+W 
```

## Save file / Save Workbook CTRL+S 

```
* Saving your work regularly should become second nature. 
* This shortcut will help. 
* If you haven't saved your file beforehand, 
* Excel will ask you to assign a name 
* and storage location to your file. 
* If you have, this shortcut will quickly save your file. CTRL+S 
```

## Select all CTRL+A 

```
* The select all shortcut actually behaves differently based on context. 
* If you are in an empty cell and select all, you will select the entire worksheet. 
* If the active cell contains data that is part of a group (cells containing contiguous data) 
* select all will just select the group of cells instead. 
* You can press it again to select the entire worksheet. 
* The shortcut for select all is: CTRL+A 
```

## Enter a new line of Text ALT + Enter

```
* Sometimes when entering data into a cell, 
* you may want to go to a new line below your current one, within the same cell. 
* Rather than let Excel choose when this happens 
* you can use this key press combination to force this behaviour. 
* When editing a cell, press: ALT + Enter
```

## Moving around the worksheet

```
* You can use the arrow keys to move a single cell in any direction. 
* Page Up and Page Down will move one "page" (the number of rows shown on the screen) up or down. 

* CTRL+arrow keys will move to the next blank cell in that direction. 

* If you have a large dataset with no gaps this will move to the edges of the dataset. 

* CTRL+Home takes you to the first cell that contains data in the top-left corner of the sheet. 

* CTRL+End goes to the last cell in the bottom-right. 

* On certain keyboards without a Home key, 
* you might need to use CTRL+Fn+Home to use this shortcut.
```
## Cycling Cell References F4 (fn + F4) 

```
* F4 (fn + F4) 
* Cycle through all 4 types of cell references (Absolute, Mixed x2, Relative)
* Each time you press the shortcut key, the cell reference cycles through four states:

$A$1 - Both column and row are absolute
A$1 - Only row is absolute
$A1 - Only column is absolute
A1 - Both column and row are relative
```
