# Manipulate rows and columns

## Group rows and columns

- The principle is to group together rows or columns so that you can hide or display them together.
- This way, you can have many columns that may hinder readability, while still needing all this information.  

```
The solution could then be to group columns together.
To group columns, select the columns concerned, then in the Data tab, click on the Group icon

To hide grouped columns:
Either click on the "-" sign and the columns will be hidden 
(you can then click on the "+" sign to make them reappear);

Or click on the "1" (you will click on "2" to make them reappear).

If you no longer need to group the columns, 
and you don't want to display the (+) and (-) symbols above the columns anymore, 
you need to ungroup the columns.

To ungroup columns, select the relevant columns, 
then in the Data tab, click on the Ungroup icon.
