# Basic Chart Types

## Where do you find the Chart tools?

```
* The Charts group is located on the INSERT tab. 
```

## When creating a chart, 

```
It is best to select your data and headers first.
```

## When you select empty cells, 

```
* Excel believes that this was done on purpose and, 
* instead of interpreting row 3 as the header row, 
* will try to interpret it as a series of the data. 
```
